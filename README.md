# Trafficsign_Detection_Recognition_MATLAB_RandomForest
Detect traffic sign and recognize them using Image Processing algorithms and Machine Learning(Random Forest)

To tun the code:
1. Run extract_hog_features file
2. make necessary changes such as path directory, cell size and image size
3. Run Training_and_Model_Accuracy file to train the model
4. Change the number of trees as per needed
